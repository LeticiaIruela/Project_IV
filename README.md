# Customer Segmentation for SuperStore

## Description
The Customer Segmentation for SuperStore project aims to analyze customer data to launch a targeted campaign to increase customer recurrence and cart value. The dataset used for analysis is named SuperStore. The project utilizes SQL, Python, and Tableau to extract insights from the data and develop an effective marketing strategy.

In this project, we have obtained the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scores from the provided data. RFM analysis is a powerful technique used to segment customers based on their purchase behavior and value. By leveraging RFM scores, we can identify different customer segments with varying levels of engagement and prioritize marketing efforts accordingly.

## Strategy & Metholody
The strategy employed in this project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Retrieval**: Utilizing Python, customer data is extracted from the SuperStore database. This data includes information such as purchase history, customer demographics, and order details.

2. **RFM Analysis**: Using Python, RFM scores are calculated for each customer based on the recency of their last purchase, the frequency of their purchases, and the monetary value of their transactions. These scores provide a quantitative measure of customer engagement and value.

3. **Segmentation**: The RFM scores are used to segment customers into distinct groups using appropriate clustering techniques. This segmentation helps identify customer segments with different characteristics and behaviors.

4. **Insights and Visualization**: Tableau is utilized to visualize the segmented customer groups, allowing for a clear understanding of their distribution and characteristics. Key insights are derived from the visualizations to guide the development of targeted marketing strategies.  

5. **Campaign Development**: Based on the insights gained from the segmentation analysis, a targeted marketing campaign is designed to increase customer recurrence and cart value. This may involve personalized recommendations, exclusive offers, or tailored messaging for each customer segment.
